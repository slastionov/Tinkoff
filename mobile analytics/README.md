The notebook contains python code to solve home-tasks from the [Data Analysis Course] for Moscow State University students by Tinkoff Education 2021 I've enrolled in March 2023.   



Used [Amplitudes](https://analytics.amplitude.com/demo) service to perform a mobile app analytics (DAU, WAU, MAU, platform analysis, top actions, top genres depending on platform, monthly conversion rate, user path analysis, relative frequency analysis, retention, sessions length statistics, triggers analysis, etc).  

 



Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding, data analytics and SQL skills or will be just fun for you to look through.
