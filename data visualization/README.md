The notebook contains python code to solve home-tasks from the [Data Analysis Course] for Moscow State University students by Tinkoff Education 2021 I've enrolled in March 2023.   



Python, numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib and datetime libraries and modules were used to solve tasks. Types of visualizations used: line plot, scatter plot, barplot, combo (twin) plots, box plot and scatter plot with regression (regplot).  

 



Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding, data analytics and SQL skills or will be just fun for you to look through.
