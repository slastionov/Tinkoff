The notebook contains SQL queries to solve home-tasks from the [Data Analysis Course] for Moscow State University students by Tinkoff Education 2021 I've enrolled in March 2023.   



SQL queries contain SELECT, DISTINCT, COUNT, AS, FROM, WHERE, LEFT JOIN, INNER JOIN, ON, IS, WITH, AVG, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, LIMIT, CAST, BETWEEN, AND, SUM operators.  
PostgreSQL via PgAdmin 4 was used to access database and solve tasks.  

 



Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding, data analytics and SQL skills or will be just fun for you to look through.
