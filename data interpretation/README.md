The notebook contains python code to solve home-tasks from the [Data Analysis Course] for Moscow State University students by Tinkoff Education 2021 I've enrolled in March 2023.   



Found an example of a biased poll and interpreted why it is biased; calculated conversion rate and plotted results with help of pandas and seaborn; defined metrics that will help me to answer particular business questions; formulated ten hypothesis on why we had two times less visitors this week in comparison to the previous one. 

 



Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding, data analytics and SQL skills or will be just fun for you to look through.
