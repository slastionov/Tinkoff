The notebook contains python code to solve home-tasks from the [Data Analysis Course] for Moscow State University students by Tinkoff Education 2021 I've enrolled in March 2023.   



Used statsmodels.stats and scipy.stats to find p-value. Performed A/B test with help of t-test, non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test and proportions z-test (for binominal distribution) to make statistically significant conclusions.

 



Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding, data analytics and SQL skills or will be just fun for you to look through.
